Components are simply reusable UI elements. Components exist in 2 types: With and without JavaScript.
If the component has no JavaScript it going in the component folder. If it does, place the
.hbs in the component sub-folder under templates, and the corresponding .js file in the 
component folder. Components can be placed in the code in the standard Ember way, using the 
{{component-name}} syntax.

IMPORTANT: Components MUST include a hyphen (-). This is an Ember convention, and they will
fail to include without warning if ommited.
