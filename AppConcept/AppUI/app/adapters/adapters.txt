The adapter handles how Ember talks to the back-end API.
A series of different standard adapters exist. For this project, the back-end API is coded 
to adhere to the standard RESTAdapter. Further customization has been added to specify the host,
which authorization service to use, as well as appending the authorization header to the 
API call.
